🌟 Overview
An intelligent AI teaching assistant that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to transform traditional video courses into dynamic, interactive learning experiences. This innovative system enables students to ask natural language questions and receive precise, timestamped responses directly from course videos, revolutionizing how educational content is consumed and accessed.

🚀 Key Features
Feature	Description
🎯 Natural Language Queries	Students can ask questions in plain English about course content without needing to know specific keywords
⏱️ Precise Timestamp References	Get exact video locations where topics are covered with second-level accuracy
📚 Multi-Video Knowledge Base	Simultaneously searches across entire course libraries for comprehensive answers
🧠 Semantic Understanding	Goes beyond simple keyword matching to understand context and intent
🎓 Personalized Learning	Directs students to relevant content based on their specific questions and knowledge gaps
🛠️ Technology Stack
Speech-to-Text: OpenAI Whisper Large-v2 for highly accurate video transcription

Embeddings: BGE-M3 model for advanced semantic text embeddings

LLM: Llama 3.2 via Ollama for intelligent, context-aware response generation

Similarity Search: Cosine similarity with scikit-learn for precise content retrieval

Audio Processing: FFmpeg for efficient video-to-audio conversion

📋 How It Works

Video Processing: Convert course videos to audio and transcribe content with high accuracy

Embedding Generation: Create semantic embeddings for all text chunks using advanced NLP models

Query Processing: Analyze student questions using sophisticated natural language understanding

Contextual Response: Generate helpful, informative responses with precise video references

🚀 Quick Start
Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
FFmpeg installed and configured
Ollama with required models

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Sambhavv1/RAG-AI-Teaching-Assistant.git
cd RAG-AI-Teaching-Assistant
Install Python dependencies:

bash
pip install openai-whisper requests scikit-learn pandas numpy joblib
Add educational videos to the videos/ directory

Usage Pipeline
Execute the processing pipeline in sequence:

bash
# Convert videos to audio format
python video_to_mp3.py

# Transcribe audio to structured text
python mp3_to_json.py

# Generate semantic embeddings
python preprocess_json.py

# Start interactive query system
python process_incoming.py
💡 Example Interaction
Student Question:

"Where are inline and block elements taught in the course?"

AI Response:

"The concept of inline and block elements is comprehensively covered in Video 8: 'Inline & Block Elements in HTML'. The topic is introduced at the beginning of the video (0:00) with foundational concepts, followed by detailed explanations of specific elements between 3:30-6:45. Practical examples and implementation guidance are provided from 8:15 onward. I recommend starting from the beginning to build a solid understanding of how these elements differ and when to apply them in your HTML projects."
